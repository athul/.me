Most of my time I spend on my Side Projects. I experiment with a variety of stuff and hone my skills with these projects. I mostly use Python and Go for these stuff and sometime JavaScript. For backend stuff I use either FastAPI or Django(Python) and Echo or Gin for Go. For frontend, I always prefer Vue.js or just use a templating library(Jinja or Go Templates). Checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/athul) for other projects.

## Hobby Projects

These are mainly my Mechanical Keyboard projects

### Ergodash

My first mechanical keyboard build. Cost me nearly $100(â‚¹7000) but it was really worth it.

### CRKBD/Corne

My second mechanical keyboard build. Cost me less than $100. I am liking the 40% keyboard usage.

### Ferricy

34 Key keyboard. Low Profile. Custom designed the PCB(forked and changed the silkscreen). Had to import the Switches and Keycaps from Canada.

### Corne Wireless

Xiao based Wireless Corne. Cute 3D printed case.

### KLOR

Most elaborate keyboard after Ergodash. Big OLED Screens makes it a lot more fun
