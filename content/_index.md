# Hey 👋

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

My Name is **Athul Cyriac Ajay**. I'm from Kottayam, Kerala, India. 

{{< callout emoji="👨‍💻" text="Currently working as an **SRE at [KnowBe4](https://knowbe4.com)**">}}

I used to be a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/athul) and an [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program). I spend my weekends travelling on my bike or hacking on my side projects. Read more about my [Projects](/projects). I have a hobby of building [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) especially split keyboards.

I have been writing code in Python from 2018 after my High School studies. Before that I used to write C++ for school stuff. I have been writing back-end in Django and Flask and have worked on a few college Projects. I'm also proficient in Go and has experience writing CLIs and Backend Projects.
