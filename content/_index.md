# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

My Name is **Athul Cyriac Ajay**. I'm from Kottayam, Kerala, India. I'm a student developer, a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/athul) and an [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program). I spend my weekends attending Hackathons and hacking on my side projects. Read more about my [Projects](/projects). I have a hobby of building [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) especially split keyboards.

I have been writing code in Python from 2018 after my High School studies. Before that I used to write C++ for school stuff. I have been writing back-end in Django and Flask and have worked on a few college Projects. I also shifted from Python to Go in late 2019, I have a few projects with Go. 

I write technical blogs for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/aajay) and for [Logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/athulcyriac/). I write about my side projects and other experiences on my [personal blog](/blog). I also have a small digital garden, it's actually a work in progress from September 2020, you can read my notes and stuff [here](https://athul.github.io/notes).

Currently I'm pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in _Computer Science and Engineering_ from [College of Engineering Kidangoor](https://ce-kgr.org) under [APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University](https://ktu.edu.in). I'll graduate by 2022. I have previously been an Intern at [Frappe](https://frappe.io) for Summer 2021 and [Algoshelf](https://angel.co/company/algoshelf) for Summer of 2020.
