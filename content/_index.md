# Hey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

My Name is **Athul Cyriac Ajay**. I'm from Kottayam, Kerala, India. 

I currently work as an **SRE at [KnowBe4](https://knowbe4.com)** in Kochi and I live there too.

I generally spend my weekends travelling on my bike/car, hacking on my side projects, watching movies or you know just sleeping. I have a hobby of building [Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) especially split keyboards.

I have been writing code in Python from 2018 after my High School studies. Before that I used to write C++ for school stuff. I have been writing back-end in Django and Flask and have worked on a few college Projects. I'm also proficient in Go and has experience writing CLIs and Backend Projects.

I graduated from my Bachelor's Degree in _Computer Science and Engineering_ from [College of Engineering Kidangoor](https://ce-kgr.org) under [APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University](https://ktu.edu.in) in 2022.
