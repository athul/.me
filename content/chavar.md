All the ചവർ side activities I do.

## Photography

I take photos of the Night Sky and Random stuff. Most of the time, it's just the night sky. I take pictures on my Phone(night sky pictures too)

Checkout my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/athul_c_ajay) for my photographs and stuff

## Astrophotography

It's mostly Amateur astronomy+astrophotography. I really like looking at the night sky and joining the starry dots in the sky. I have no idea on how ancient humans could shape images from the stars. I mostly use stellarium from my Phone to find out the constellations.

## Cycling

I recently bought a bicycle and has been cycling every morning for an hour. It's not a fancy $$ cycle, rather a simple MTB with Gears. The roads here are full of gutters and edged gutters, taking a road bike seemed innappropriate for the terrain. Check my strava activity to find more.
