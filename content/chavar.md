All the ചവർ side activities I do.

## Guitar

Learning to play the Guitar is my post-20-age-crisis. I'm learning it online and started to learn in August 2021. It's been fun and I've lost all the sensation of my fingertips(callusses).

## Mechanical Keyboards

I m very fond of Mechanical Keybaords. I build a macropad with mechanical switches myself and it's been quite rewarding.

## Photography

I take photos of the Night Sky and Random stuff. Most of the time, it's just the night sky. I take pictures on my Phone(night sky pictures too)

Checkout my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/athul_c_ajay) for my photographs and stuff

## Cycling

I recently bought a bicycle and has been cycling every day for an hour+. It's not a fancy $$ cycle, rather a simple MTB with Gears. The roads here are full of gutters and edged gutters, taking a road bike seemed innappropriate for the terrain.
